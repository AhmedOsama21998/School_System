School managment system using c and data structures
This project is focused on student record services in school, so it is named “School Management System”. 
Here, you can create a new student, update information of an existing student, view and manage scores, check the details of an existing student, remove existing student and view student’ list. 
The function we are looking for: 
• MAIN_MENU () – this function displays the welcome screen and targeted activates. 
• NEW_STUDENT() – this function creates a new student account. it asks about details of the student such as name, date of birth, ID, address and phone number. 
• DELETE_STUDENT() – this function is for deleting a customer account. 
• STUDENT_LIST() –this function, you can view the students information such as name, date of birth, ID, address and phone number in table form (alphabetically ascending). 
• STUDENT_EDIT() – this function has been used for updating a particular student account. 
• RANK_STUDENT() –this function can sort all students according to computer science score. 
• STUDENT_SCORE() – this function has been used for updating score of all students.

In this Project I creat Two systems for manager and student ,
the manager has password (1234) you can change it if you get pass worng three time the system will logout ,
So the manager has access to Create ,Delete ,Edit , Enter score and view list of Student .
Then Student with out password can access The rank for(computer science score) and Knowing the number of Students in the School.
